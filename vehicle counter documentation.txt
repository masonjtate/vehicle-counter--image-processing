# Introduction-
I love the idea of smart cities. The thought of automated smart energy systems, electrical grids, one-touch access ports – it’s an enthralling concept! Honestly, it’s a dream for a data scientist and I’m delighted that a lot of cities around the world are moving towards becoming smarter. <br>
One of the core components of a smart city is automated traffic management. And that got me thinking – could I use my data science chops to build a vehicle detection model that could play a part in smart traffic management?
Think about it – if you could integrate a vehicle detection system in a traffic light camera, you could easily track a number of useful things simultaneously: 

* How many vehicles are present at the traffic junction during the day?
* What time does the traffic build up? 
* What kind of vehicles are traversing the junction (heavy vehicles, cars, etc.)?
* Is there a way to optimize the traffic and distribute it through a different street?
* And so on. The applications are endless!

We humans can easily detect and recognize objects from complex scenes in a flash. Translating that thought process to a machine, however, requires us to learn the art of object detection using computer vision algorithms.
So in this project, we will be building an automatic vehicle detector and counter model.

####   steps followed while making this project:-----------------------
1.Read the video frame by frame.

2.Apply some fileters to the frame(dilation, etc.).

3.Use BackgroundSubtractor to split the foreground from background(white-foreground, black-background).

4.Detect the contours of the foreground(moving objects).

5.Calculate the centroid of each moving object.

6.For each centroid, detect if there's a nearby centroid of the last frame. If so, assign them to the same vehicle.

7.For each vehicle, detect whether it crossed the target line.


##-----------------The Idea Behind Detecting Moving Objects in Videos--------------
Object detection is a fascinating field in computer vision. It goes to a whole new level when we’re dealing with video data. The complexity rises up a notch, but so do the rewards!
We can perform super useful high-value tasks such as surveillance, traffic management, fighting crime, etc. using object detection algorithms
